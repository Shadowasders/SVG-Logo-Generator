  ## Project Description
  For this project, I decieded to deepen my understanding of inqurier and node to create an SVG icon generator, this generator will run on the CLI and take user input to create a customizied Icon for any project!

  ## Installation
  Download from git, install the dependencies, and use npm start!

  ## Usage
  Run the project, answer the prompts, and enjoy your free icon!

  ## Testing
  The triangle icons can be a bit testy, future testing would be to create a sepreate function for triangles to perfectly align them with the text. It is perfectly functional, but everything can be improved!

  ## Credits
  A huge thank you to all my tutors, and instructors for help with this project. Testing in JS is a little tricky to understand, and your patience with me going through this is something I won't forget!
